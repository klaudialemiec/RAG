He previously served as the Minister of Public Works from 1920 to 1922 and briefly as Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1922. A renowned engineer and politically independent, Narutowicz was the first non-Catholic to be elected president of Poland. His assassination was a major political crisis in Poland and led to a period of instability.\n"
